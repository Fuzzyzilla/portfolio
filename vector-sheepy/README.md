# `vector-sheepy`
A wasm library for rendering a provided mesh with interactive Webgl2-based physics. To reduce binary size, the mesh
is unsanitarily `include`d into the source code, since this is a hacky project just for my portfolio. Nonetheless,
the other crate in this workspace, `preprocessor`, should allow you to generate these mesh files with some tinkering.
